The Site Pages section now displays the pages in an order that matches the layout of your site, so it’s easier to find what you’re looking for.
The tyranny of the blank page is no more! We’ve added suggestions for next steps to every page without content.
When you write a new post, the app automatically saves drafts on your device, so none of your work is ever lost.
We’ve restyled a few more screens to keep improving consistency across the app.
Plus some bug fixes and general reliability improvements, as always.
